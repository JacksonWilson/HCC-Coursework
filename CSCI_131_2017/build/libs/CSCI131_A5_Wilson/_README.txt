Hopefully you will be able to run this assignment like usual with:
	java -jar CSCI131_A5_Wilson.jar

But since I cannot get the uaccess jars to work without explictly stating them in the -cp argument, I have to run this assignment with:
	java -cp "CSCI131_A5_Wilson.jar;[path to uaccess jars]" assignments.a5.Driver
